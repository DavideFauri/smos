description: Documentation for the Smos Calendar Import Tool, for importing your calendar into Smos

This tool exists to import your calendar from an external source into Smos.

Make sure to run it periodically.

Note that you can also ignore specific events while importing, by adding `SMOS_NO_CALENDAR_IMPORT` to their description.


See [the instructions for running it on NixOS](/smos-calendar-import/nixos) for automation for that on NixOS.
